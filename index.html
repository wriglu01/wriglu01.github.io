  <p>Currently in the job market to find a job in Health Care Administration.<br> 
  Ultimately I plan to be the Administrator of a CCRC nursing facility somewhere in the Upper Midwest.<br>
  I personally would like to coach a basketball or football team at the high school level because I do not think I want to coach at the college level. <br>
  I am a big fan of warm, tropical places and my background is a great example of the ideal day for me.<br>
  Luther College has allowed me to explore into areas I would not have otherwise thought of and I am thankful for the opportunities I have had at Luther College!</p>
