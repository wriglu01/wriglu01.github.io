  <p>Currently in the job market to find a job in Health Care Administration. Ultimately I plan to be the Administrator of a CCRC nursing facility somewhere in the Upper Midwest. I personally would like to coach a basketball or football team at the high school level because I do not think I want to coach at the college level. Luther College has allowed me to explore into areas I would not have otherwise thought of and I am thankful for the opportunities I have had at Luther College!</p>
